  <!-- <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <h4>
    Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://scale.com/">Scale AI</a>
  </h4>
  <p class="dates">December 2020 – January 2021</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Worked on machine learning infrastructure for a fast-growing startup using
      Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed an in-house system to unify the ML training workflow, allowing
      the team to quickly iterate on models, share results on a tracking server,
      and launch Kubernetes distributed training jobs, saving “hours” of time on
      each experiment.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>
    Architecture Intern at
    <a href="https://www.nvidia.com">Nvidia</a>
  </h4>
  <p class="dates">June 2020 – August 2020</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Implemented
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10821"
        >state-of-the-art deep learning models</a
      >
      for semantic segmentation on street image datasets (Cityscapes, KITTI).
    </li>
    <li>
      Worked with the Applied Deep Learning Research (ADLR) group to optimize
      and rewrite their code, implementing new research model architectures from
      scratch. Produced efficient PyTorch code that can be evaluated in real
      time on edge devices with TensorRT. Released an open-source library.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>
    Research Assistant at
    <a href="https://pl.seas.harvard.edu/"
      >Harvard Programming Languages Group</a
    >
  </h4>
  <p class="dates">June 2020 – August 2020</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Worked on a C++ compiler for
      <a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog">Formulog</a>, a variant of
      Datalog that supports ML-like syntax extension and SMT queries.
    </li>
    <li>
      Generated highly parallel templatized C++17 code, used caching in B-Tree
      comparisons to speed up Datalog evaluation by 16x, and optimized existing
      OpenMP code using lockless data structures for an additional 4x speedup.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wrote a handwritten parser that was 30x faster than the ANTLR-generated
      LL(*) parser and used 20x less memory (80 GB to 4 GB).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>
    Undergraduate Researcher at
    <a href="https://www.predmed.org/">Predictive Medicine Group</a>
  </h4>
  <p class="dates">December 2019 – June 2020</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Conducted research in statistics & medical informatics advised by Ben Reis
      (Harvard Medical School), developing temporal models to identify patients
      at high risk of suicide based on medical histories obtained from
      Massachusetts General Hospital.
    </li>
  </ul>

      <em>F=ma Contests: 2011-2019 Solutions Manual</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provided detailed solutions for nine years of past <em>F=ma</em> contests
      to encourage physics interest among high school students.
    </li>
    <li>
      Published with the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) and AIP
      Publishing, preprint available
      <a href="https://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/2020/pastexams.cfm">online</a>.
